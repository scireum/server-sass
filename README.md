server-sass
======

A simple implementation of a compiler which transforms SASS to CSS files - without requiring you to include jRuby,
JavaScript or other monsters.

The idea is to only implement those features of SASS, which we really need - but have these in superior quality.
Therefore we have a test coverage of 80%+ of all lines using automated tests. If there is a missing feature,
feel free to fork ;-)

For a good description on SASS go to: http://sass-lang.com

Using it is as simple as:

```java
Generator gen = new Generator();
// Parses and expands test.scss - Files are resolved from the classpath, subclass Generator and
// override the resolve method, to change this behavior.
gen.importStylesheet("test.scss");
// Finalize expansions and evaluate expressions
gen.compile();
// Access css sources
StringWriter out = new StringWriter();
Output output = new Output(out, false);
gen.generate(out);
String css = out.toString();
```
If you also need a modern, rock solid web framework which has this module already built in, have
a look at SIRIUS: https://sirius-lib.net (CSS is auto-generated for .scss files by the AssetsDispatcher: https://github.com/scireum/sirius-web/blob/master/src/main/java/sirius/web/dispatch/AssetsDispatcher.java#L168)

server-sass is part of the open source initiative of scireum GmbH (http://www.scireum.de)
